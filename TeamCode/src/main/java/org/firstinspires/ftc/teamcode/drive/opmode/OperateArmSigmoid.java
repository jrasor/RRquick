/**
 * This OpMode operates a single servo arm forward and back, using the gamepad Y button
 * (DEPLOYed) the A button to go back (STOWed). The code is structured as a LinearOpMode.
 *
 * The motion follows a sigmoid angle vs time function over the interval (0, 1):
 *
 *        r (t) = 0.5 - 0.5 * cos (Ï€t)
 *
 *  This function starts slowly from zero, builds up some speed until the halfway
 *  point is reached, then slows down to gently approach the endpoint.
 *
 *  The domain and range can be scaled. The initial position can be other than zero.
 *
 *  CYCLE_MS sets the update period for position and reports.
 *
 *  We assume an instance of the Servo class, configured with the name "arm" as is
 *  found on a Trainerbot.
