/**
 *      This OpMode continuously scans a single servo back and forwards until Stop is pressed,
 * following a sigmoid angle vs time function over the interval (0, 1):
 *
 *      r (t) = 0.5 - 0.5 * cos (Ï€t)
 *
 *      This function starts slowly from zero, builds up some speed until the halfway
 *  point is reached, then slows down to gently approach the endpoint.
 *      The domain and range can be scaled.
 *
 *      The code is structured as a LinearOpMode.
 *      CYCLE_MS sets the update period.
 *
 *      This code assumes a servo with the name "arm" as found on a Trainerbot.
 *
 *      NOTE: When any servo position is set, ALL attached servos are activated, so ensure
 * that any other connected servos are able to move freely before running this test.
